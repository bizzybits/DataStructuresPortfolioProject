# DataStructuresPortfolioProject
My very own undirected and directed graph structures!

The two files contained in this repo were my final assignment and porfolio project for the Oregon State University College of Engineering, CS261 -- Data Structures course. Including Dijkstra's algorithm!



Over the term I implemented the following data structures from scratch:

  + dynamic arrays
  + bags
  + stacks
  + queues
  + deques
  + linked lists (cdll, dll, sll)
  + binary search trees
  + AVL trees, balancing and rotations
  + priority queues
  + heaps
  + hash tables 
  + hash maps
  + graphs (directed and undirected)
